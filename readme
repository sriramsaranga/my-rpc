Usage:
	Server: ./newSever
	Client: telnet ip portno

Description:
	This is an RPC server which either executes the given command or reads the file given, based on the given INPUT
	Input should be: 		EXEC command
					READ filename
					EXIT

Example:
	./newServer
	EXEC ls ~/
	** displays list of files and directories present in HOME directory.**
	READ /home/user/dir/files.txt
	** displays the contents of text files **

Test Cases:
	Initial test case was reading the source Code which ran without any problem.
	
	After connecting the client with the server, 
	I tested the following:
			1) READ newServer.java
			2) EXEC ipconfig
			3) EXEC ping google.com
			
	But when executing 'dir' Command I found a problem. I found out the reason that dir runs only through cmd
	application, but others mentioned above are stand alone. So i included "cmd.exec /c " to the commands so 
	as to get output for all the commands.
	
	This program also identifies Invalid commands, programs and Invalid filenames, commands in EXEC and READ commands 
	respectively.
